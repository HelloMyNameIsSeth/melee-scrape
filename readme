Script to access a melee.gg webpage and output the results into a xls document. 

When the script accesses data it takes from the matches and not from the standing. Does this as not all melee events get recorded / finished. 

1. Install packages
2. Create a list of melee usernames (case sensitive) and place them in output.txt. See output as example. 
3. Update the 'ID' field with the melee id in the link 
    - In this example 'ID' = 00000 https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/00000 
4. Depending on the number of rounds it will take about 20 - 30 seconds. It has been rate limited. 
5. xls output will generate.
